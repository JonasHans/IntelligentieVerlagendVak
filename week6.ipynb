    "  <li>Implement the two algorithms in Fig MRS.13.2, using your earlier code for creating term and document frequencies.\n",
    "  It might be easier to use the representation and formula given in MRS section 13.4.1.</li>\n",
    "  <li>On this collection, train NB text classifiers for 10 different classes with enough and interesting data.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Compute for each term and each of your 10 classes its utility for that class using mutual information.</li>\n",
    "  <li>For each class, show the top 10 words as in Figure 13.7 in MRS.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Evaluate your classifiers using Precision, Recall and F1. (\n",
    "       <br/>\n",
    "      Give a table in which you show these values for using the top 10, top 100 terms and all terms, for all of your 10 classes.\n",

    "<li> You have done the complete implementation by yourself. Congratulations! You can also use `scikit-learn` routines for all of this work. Do that. So follow [this text classification tutorial](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html)  and implement the same steps but now with your kamervragen dataset. Also use [mutual information feature selection](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html) to select the K-best features, and compare the results as before.\n",
